Implement same flow as pinturillo2,



Set a username -- if the username is on the list of users, add an integer at the end
// Might want to register as a user for X reason?

After setting the username you now have the option between: 

Quick join lobby (game should not be in progress, if no open lobbies, create one)
Create/join private game
Find a lobby (list of open lobbies)

Implement and use these libraries:
🗸 Sass + loader
☐ Redux-saga
☐ Look into tmux!



//BACKEND
If no players in lobby, remove it
